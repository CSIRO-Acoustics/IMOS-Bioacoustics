    <h1>Operations</h1>

The operations data set is the list of ship's operations. 
These activities are recorded into the on ship database as the activity occurs.<br>
<br>
All times are in UTC (GMT). The local timezone offset is recorded.<br>
<br>
All positions are ship positions.<br>
<br>
For each operation the time and location is recorded for each of:
<table>
<tr><td>Deployment start</td><td>When the equipment was put over the side</td></tr>
<tr><td>Operation start</td><td>When sampling commenced</td></tr>
<tr><td>Operation end</td><td>When sampling finished</td></tr>
<tr><td>Deployment end</td><td>When the equipment came on board</td></tr>
</table>
Operations are displayed as a straight line between operation start and operation end locations with a symbol
representing the operation type at each end of the line. 
The line does not represent the ship's track during that period.
The operation start and end locations represent the ship's location, 
not the location of the sampling instrument, which in the case of towed equipment, 
such as sleds and video cameras, may have a layback in the order of twice the water depth.

<h2>Loading</h2>

<h3>Types</h3>
You may restrict the operation types to those you select from the list. 
If no types are selected they will all be loaded.

<h3>Geographic bounds</h3>
You may restrict the operations to those that include a particular area. 
Enter the north, south, east and west latitudes and longitudes. 
Any operations which are within or pass through the region you defined will be loaded.
An operation "passes through" the region if the rectangle defined by the operation start
and end locations overlaps with the region at all.

<h3>Load</h3>
The <code>Load</code> button will load all operations of the currently selected types 
which fall within the region in to the display area.

<h3>Cancel</h3>
The <code>Cancel</code> button will be available between when you press the <code>Load</code> button
and when the operations are displayed. Pressing the <code>Cancel</code> button will abort the
load, but will not remove any already loaded data.

It will normally take very little time to load the operations data, so the <code>Cancel</code> button
may not be available.

<h3>Remove</h3>
The <code>Remove</code> button will remove those operations of the type you currently have selected.

<h3>Remove All</h3> 
The <code>RemoveAll</code> button will remove all operations from the display.
