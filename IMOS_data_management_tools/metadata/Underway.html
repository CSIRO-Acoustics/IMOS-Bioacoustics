    <h1>Underway</h1>

Underway data is data logged by the ship's system while the vessel is underway.<br>
<br>
Data is logged from the following instruments:
<table>
<tr><td>GPS</td><td>The Geographic Positioning System provides information on the location of the vessel</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><table>
	      <tr><td>mode</td><td></td></tr>
	      <tr><td>pdop</td><td></td></tr>
	      <tr><td>speed_og</td><td>Speed Over Ground - the speed of the vessel relative to the earth,
		    as calculated by the GPS</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>speed_ow</td><td>Speed Over Water</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>course_og</td><td>Course Over Ground - the direction the vessel has moved, 
		    relative to the earth.</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>heading</td><td>The direction the ship is pointing</td></tr>
</table></td></tr>
<tr><td>EK</td><td>The Simrad EK500 echosounder</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><table>
	      <tr><td>sea_depth</td><td>The depth of the sea floor, according to the current settings of the echosounder.
		  The accuracy of this measure will depend on the settings and whether they match the current environment. 
		  In particular this measure is sensitive to the speed of sound through water,
		  which varies with water temperature and conductivity.</td></tr>
</table></td></tr>
<tr><td>Data Taker</td><td>The data taker connected to the meteorological sensors</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><table>
	      <tr><td>air_temp</td><td>Air temperature</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>water_temp</td><td>Sea water temperature</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>wind_speed</td><td>Wind speed (knots?)</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>wind_dir</td><td>Wind direction in degrees true</td></tr>
	      <tr><td>light</td><td></td></tr>
</table></td></tr>
<tr><td>Thermosalinograph</td><td>Water characteristics as measured at the thermosalinograph</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td><table>
	      <tr><td>salinity</td><td></td></tr>
	      <tr><td>water_temp</td><td>Sea water temperature at the thermosalinograph.
		The water temperature is likely to have been affected by travel through the ship to the instrument.</td></tr>

<h2>Loading</h2>

Data can be loaded for only one area at a time, although more
than one attribute of the dataset may be displayed (using different symbols
for each  attribute). Once a dataset is loaded the geographic bounds and
time range options are disabled and ignored. Removing all loaded datasets
will enable new bounds to  be entered.<br>
<br>
You may restrict the data loaded by either geographic bounds or time range, or both. 
At least one restriction should be applied as this is a very large data set.

<h3>Attribute</h3>
Which data attribute you wish to display. This is the attribute to be used for colouring the data points.
You must select one.<br>
<br>
All attributes may be viewed in the data point details panel for underway data.<br>
<br>
More than one data attribute may be displayed by selecting a different attribute and symbol 
(and optionally colour table) and loading it. 
Each attribute and symbol must be selected one pair at a time, and the <code>Load</code> button pressed.
Loading an additional attribute of an already loaded dataset is does not take anything like as long as 
loading the dataset.<br>
<br>
Only one data set can be loaded at a time, even though multiple attributes of the dataset may be plotted.
<h3>Symbol</h3>
Select which symbol you would like to use to display this attribute. You must select one.
<h3>Geographic bounds</h3>
You may restrict the data loaded to a geographic area. 
Fill in the bounds either by typing them in or by middle dragging the mouse to define the area.
Double middle click of the mouse will clear the current bounds.<br>
<br>
Once a data set has been loaded the geographic bounds will be ignored until the data set has been removed.
A data set can be removed either by the <code>RemoveAll</code> button or by the <code>File, Clear</code> menu option.

<h3>Time range</h3>
You may restrict the data loaded to a time range.
Fill in the start and end times for data to load. 
All times are in UTC (GMT).
<h3>Colour table</h3>
You must select a colour table to use from the predefined list.<br>
<br>
You may choose to apply either a linear or logarithmic scale to colour the data.
Some data sets, such as single beam indices and echosounder depth 
are better displayed using a log scale.<br>
<br>
The colour table may either range over the set of data values, "<code>Auto 
range</code>",  of range over the minimum and maximum values you enter. You 
can reverse the colour scale by setting the minimum value greater than the 
maximum value.  

<h3>Load</h3>
The <code>Load</code> button will load all operations of the currently selected types 
which fall within the region in to the display area.

<h3>Cancel</h3>
The <code>Cancel</code> button will be available between when you press the <code>Load</code> button
and when the data is displayed. Pressing the <code>Cancel</code> button will abort the
load.<br>
<br>
The data may take some time to load, especially if large or no bounds are applied. 
While the data is loading the program may still be used as normal, 
albeit with reduced performance as the data loading activity occurs in the background.

<h3>Remove</h3>
The <code>Remove</code> button will remove the selected attribute from the display.

<h3>Remove All</h3> 
The <code>RemoveAll</code> button will remove the current underway data set, 
and allow a new data set to be selected.

<h3>Re-colour</h3>
The <code>Re-colour</code> button will apply the currently selected colour table and range 
to the currently selected data set.
