	Photographs may be any georeferenced still image.
	Normally they are photographs taken of the bottom using a slide camera.
	<br><br>
	The location of each photograph will be indicated by a small camera icon,
	similar to the above.
	To view the actual photo, click on the icon and select the <code>Photos</code>
	tab in the data display panel on the left.
	<br><br>
	Often the photos will be in a much higher resolution than the data display panel will fit.
	Click on the photo image in the data display panel to view the photo at full resolution in a
	new window.
	<br><br>
	Click with the right mouse button on the photo image in the data display panel to
	switch between full resolution and sized to fit. At full resolution scroll bars will appear,
	if required, to allow you to view any part of the image.
	<br><br>
	Click with the middle mouse button on the photo image in the data display panel to
	switch between full and half resolution versions of the image.

which fall within the region into the display area.

<h3>Cancel</h3>
The <code>Cancel</code> button will be available between when you press the <code>Load</code> button
and when the photos are displayed. Pressing the <code>Cancel</code> button will abort the
load, but will not remove any already loaded data.

<h3>Remove All</h3>
The <code>RemoveAll</code> button will remove all photos from the display.
