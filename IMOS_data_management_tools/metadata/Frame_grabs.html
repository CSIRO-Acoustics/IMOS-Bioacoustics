	Frame grabs are similar to <a href="Photos.html">photos</a>,
	except that they come from frame grabs from video operations, rather than still cameras.
	The video scores associated with the frame are also displayed in the data display panel.
	<br><br>
	The location of each frame grab will be indicated by a small camera icon,
	similar to the above.
	To view the actual image, click on the icon and select the <code>Frame grabs</code>
	tab in the data display panel on the left.
	<br><br>
	Often the image will be in a much higher resolution than the data display panel will fit.
	Click on the image in the data display panel to view the image at full resolution in a
	new window.
	<br><br>
	Click with the right mouse button on the image in the data display panel to
	switch between full resolution and sized to fit. At full resolution scroll bars will appear,
	if required, to allow you to view any part of the image.
	<br><br>
	Click with the middle mouse button on the image in the data display panel to
	switch between full and half resolution versions of the image.

<h3>Geographic bounds</h3>
You may restrict the frame grabs to those that are within a particular area.
Enter the north, south, east and west latitudes and longitudes.
Any frame grabs which are within the region you defined will be loaded.
<br><br>
If the region has zero size (eg all bounds are zero) it will be ignored
and all frame grabs in the database will be loaded.

<h3>Load</h3>
The <code>Load</code> button will load all the frame grabs
which fall within the region into the display area.

<h3>Cancel</h3>
The <code>Cancel</code> button will be available between when you press the <code>Load</code> button
and when the frame grabs are displayed. Pressing the <code>Cancel</code> button will abort the
load, but will not remove any already loaded data.


<h3>Remove</h3>
The <code>Remove</code> button will remove the frame grabs loaded by the current region.

<h3>Remove All</h3>
The <code>RemoveAll</code> button will remove all frame grabs from the display.
