	Invertebrate catches indicate the species of invertebrate fauna retrieved during bottom sampling
	operations.
	The invertebrate species are divided into 8 functional units.
	These units are used to display pie graphs of the catch composition for each operation.
	Each operation is shown by a line from the start to the end of the operation with a pie graph
	in the centre of the line.
	If no invertebrate where obtained during the operation a net symbol is used instead.

<h3>Geographic bounds</h3>
You may restrict the operations to those that include a particular area.
Enter the north, south, east and west latitudes and longitudes.
Any operations which are within or pass through the region you defined will be loaded.
An operation "passes through" the region if the rectangle defined by the operation start
and end locations overlaps with the region at all.

<h3>Load</h3>
The <code>Load</code> button will load invertebrate catch results for all operations
which fall within the region into the display area.

<h3>Cancel</h3>
The <code>Cancel</code> button will be available between when you press the <code>Load</code> button
and when the operations are displayed. Pressing the <code>Cancel</code> button will abort the
load, but will not remove any already loaded data.


<h3>Remove</h3>
The <code>Remove</code> button will remove the operations loaded by the current region.

<h3>Remove All</h3>
The <code>RemoveAll</code> button will remove all operations from the display.
