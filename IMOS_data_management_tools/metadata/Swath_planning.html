<H1 CLASS="western">DataView swath route planning</H1>
<P>This page assumes you are familiar with the DataView route
planning options provided by the Annotations tabs.</P>
<P>Tip: one or both the "Swaths" and "Annotations"
data details panes should be torn off by dragging the pink border
outside the window, otherwise there is too much swapping between
tabs.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Preparation</H2>
<P>In the "EM" datasets pane check the port and starboard
"Show swath coverage times" boxes and enter 1.7 into the
coverage multiples box.</P>
<P>Tip: running the next line at 1.7 times existing swath coverage
gets a good overlap with few gaps.</P>
<P>Tip: loading swath files uses a fair amount of memory. Every so
often it is worth coming back to the  EM tab and removing (RemoveAll)
any swath files which are no longer being used.</P>
<P>Tip: the "EM" data details pane can be used to examine
the settings used to acquire data by clicking on individual pings.</P>
<P>Tip: there is a real time version of the "EM" display
that can be used on the ship to monitor incoming data from anywhere
on the ship's network. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Existing data</H2>
<P>In the "Rasters" tab, select the "WMS"
button, choose the server <A HREF="http://c000486-hf:8080/geoserver/wms">http://c000486-hf:8080/geoserver/wms</A>
and click the "List Maps" button. Select the "Hi
res bathymetry shaded by slope [swath:bathy_slope]" or "High
resolution public bathymetry [swath:bathy_pyramid]" and click
the "Load" button.</P>
<P>Tip: It is sometime useful to also load the "GA 2009
bathymetry shaded by slope [GA:GA_bathyslope]" (or one of the
other GA 2009 layers) and "Lower"ing it below the swath
data to get an idea of the bathymetry where there is no EM300 data.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Selecting swaths</H2>
<P>In the "Swaths" datasets page load info on all the
swath files that exist in the area of interest. There are a number of
ways of doing this. The most straight forward is to get all files in
the area of the proposed voyage by restricting the geographic bounds
and loading all data.</P>
<P>Tip: geographic bounds can also be entered by shift-left dragging
in the map pane.</P>
<P>Tip: the "Active" button below the geographic bounds
must be selected for them to be applied.</P>
<P>Once all filter conditions have been entered (usually just
geographic bounds &amp; "Active") click the load button
and select the datalist you want. 
</P>
<P>/home/acoustics_swath/mbproc/em300/datalist.mb-1 is the datalist
containing all Southern Surveyor EM300 data and is usually the one to
use. 
</P>
<P>/home/acoustics_swath/datalist.mb-1 is the datalist that contains
all the swath data I have got my hands on.</P>
<P>Tip: I don't know the path to access these files from Windows.
Creating a soft link (ln -s) to /home/acoustics_swath on any of the
unix machines and accessing the file system from Windows via the unix
machine will work.</P>
<P>Loading the swath file information will take several minutes. The
"Loading data in the background" status message will be
visible at the bottom right while it is loading. If the message is no
longer visible and no rows have appeared in the Swaths table in the
"Swaths" dataset pane then the load failed.</P>
<P>Tip: Once loaded it is possible to select a subset of the loaded
data by setting the filters and clicking the "Select"
button and/or by checking the "Select" box in the data
details pane of swaths of interest. Once selected an additional row
"Your selections" is added to the table of swath sets.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Viewing swath data</H2>
<P>Swath files are displayed in the map pane by a pink boxes showing
the maximum extent of the data and blue lines from the start to end
of the data. Click on either the box or the line to see the details
for the file in the "Swaths" data details pane.</P>
<P>Clicking the "Load data" button in the "Swaths"
data detail pane will load that swath file into the "EM"
tab and the swath coverage, 2 x coverage and 1.7 x coverage lines
will appear in the map pane.</P>
<P>The new swath route should try to stay as close as possible to the
1.7 x coverage line without going outside the 2 x coverage line.</P>
<P>Tip: the last layer displayed is drawn on top. To get the route
line to appear above the (mess of) swath lines and coverages, in the
"Annotations" dataset pane uncheck and recheck the "Show"
box for the route.</P>
<P>Tip: the "Show Track" button in the "Swaths"
detail pane replaces the blue start-end line with a purple line that
follows the ships track. This can be useful for untangling which line
goes where. Downside &ndash; loading the track uses memory and there
is no mechanism to unload the track once loaded short of removing and
reloading the swaths layer.</P>
<P>Tip: the colours of the swath boxes can be changed in the table in
the "Swaths" dataset pane, the colours of the swath
coverage lines is set in the "EM" dataset pane and the
colour of the route lines can be set in either of the "Annotations"
panes.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Moving around the map</H2>
<P>To change the map view:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>middle button drag to move the map</P>
	<LI><P>shift-middle drag to draw a box to zoom into</P>
	<LI><P>control-middle drag to draw a box to zoom out to</P>
	<LI><P>click the "centre" button in the points table in
	the "Annotations" data details pane to move that point
	to the centre of the map pane</P>
	<LI><P>The right most button above the map pane restores the
	previous view. It doesn't work very well but it is sometimes useful</P>
