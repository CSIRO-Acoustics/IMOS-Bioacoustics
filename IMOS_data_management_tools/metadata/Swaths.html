<h1>Swath information</h1>
The "<code>Swaths</code>" allows loading and exploring information files generated from
the raw swath transect files.<br>
<br>
Each swath data file is drawn as a bounding box covering the total area included
by the transect and a line from the start position of the transect to the end position.
The line may not corespond at all to the actual vessel track during the transect.<br>
<br>
The raw files often contain poor quality data which is removed in data processing.
This bad data may still affect the data in the information files.
