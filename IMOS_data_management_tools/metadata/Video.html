    <h1>Video</h1>
	<h2>Summary</h2>
	Video operations occur where a video camera is used to video images.
	This is normally done by a video camera lowered from the ship and dragged just above the surface of the bottom.<br>
	<br>
	The video data is analysed and each second of the video is given a score for each of the following characteristics:
	<ul><li>Substratum </li>
	<li>Geomorphology</li>
	<li>Fauna</li>
	<li>Abundance</li>
	</ul>
	These scores can be plotted at the position of the camera.<br>
	<br>
	For some operations a short video clip of part of the transect is available (eg operations 219 and 220)
	To load the video clip you must click on the video clip as well as the operation.
	<h2>Metadata</h2>
	The video operations are those ship's <a href="Operations.html">operations</a> which involve
	towing the video camera. Each operation is given a name indicating the region in which the
	operation was performed.
	<br><br>
	Score positioning data is smoothed data based on the ship's GPS position and the SonarDyne
	positioning beacon, which gives an offset from the ship to the camera assembly.
	The jitter in the SonarDyne positioning is in the order of 10m which is significant
	compared to distances between positions, so smoothly is applied to give a sensible result.
	<br><br>
	Scores are determined manually by the scorer viewing the video and entering a new score whenever
	a change occurs. The scores are to some extend subjective as there are rarely
	clear boundaries between similar areas.

<h2>Loading</h2>

<h3>Operations</h3>
The topmost box lists video operations for which scores are available. You must select at least one operation.

<h3>Video clips</h3>
The second box displays a list of available video clips for the selected operation.
This box will be empty there is not a video clip available for the selected operation (most cases)
or if more than one operation is selected.<br>
<br>
Select a clip if you want it to be loaded.
Clips not selected will not be loaded.
<h3>Colour Table</h3>
You must select one colour table to use in colouring the scores,
if you wish to colour by any one of the scores.<br>
<br>
The colour table is ignored if you use one of the colour mix options.
<h3>Scores</h3>
You must select one score, or combination of scores to use to colour the data points.
The colour table above will colour the scores, if you select a single score.
The colour table will be ignored and a colour made by combining proportions of
red, green and blue, according to substratum, geomorphology and fauna,
will be used if you select a mix. The abundance score will affect the size of the point displayed.

<h3>Load</h3>
The <code>Load</code> button will load the selected video operation and display its scored points
in the display area.
<br><br>
If a video clip is selected it will be loaded into the display panels on the left
and square showing the score nearest the current frame drawn in the display area, along with
a yellow triangle marking the start of the clip and a pink triangle marking the end of the clip.
Clips are normally quite small in size, so it may be necessary to zoom in to separate the start and end marks.
<br><br>
Loading may take some time, depending on your computer.
The <code>Cancel</code> button will be available while loading is still in progress.
Please wait until the <code>Cancel</code> button is greyed out.

<h3>Cancel</h3>
The <code>Cancel</code> button will be available between when you press the <code>Load</code> button
and when the loading completes. Pressing the <code>Cancel</code> button will abort the
load, but will not remove any already loaded data.

<h3>Remove</h3>
The <code>Remove</code> button will remove video operations you currently have selected in the first box.

<h3>Remove All</h3> 
The <code>RemoveAll</code> button will remove all video operations from the display.
<hr>
<h3>Re-colour</h3>
The <code>Re-colour</code> button will colour the selected video operations with the currently selected
colour table and score. You can easily compare distributions of component scores by recolour the already
loaded data. Re-colouring takes very little time compared to loading a data set.
<hr>
<h2>Data Files</h2>
The video operations, scores and video clip data are held in tables in the videodb database,
db/video/videodb.script.
The data itself is held in comma separated files, operations.csv, video_scores.csv and video_clips.csv.
Descriptions of the table structure are in videodb.script.
