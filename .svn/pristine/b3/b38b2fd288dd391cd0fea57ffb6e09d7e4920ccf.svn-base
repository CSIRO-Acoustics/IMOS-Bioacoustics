% Map for mapping from EchoView CSV to IMOS NetCDF
%
% Columns are:
% IMOS_variable_name,   CSV_column_name,    Dimensions, Data_type,  QC_expression
%
% IMOS_variable_name is the name the variable will have in the output NetCDF file
%
% CSV_column_name is the column name as it appears in the first line of the input CSV file
%
% Dimensions are the dimensions of this variable, 
%   this conists of zero or more dimension names.
%   If this field is blank the variable is a dimension and it's 
%   IMOS_variable_name can appear in the Dimensions entry of other variables.
%    
% Data_type is one 0f 
%   N - a numeric value
%   S - a text string
%   D - a date in yyyymmdd format
%   T - a time in HH:MM:SS.ss format
%   DT - this column has a date and the next column is a time which make a timestamp
%
% QC_expression is a matlab formula that evalutes to an array if qc flags
% the same size as the variable it is for. The IMOS_variable_name of any
% of the dimensions and variables are visible in the context
%
% The toolbox documentation notes: http://code.google.com/p/imos-toolbox/wiki/DataStructures (Sept 2010)
%   It is assumed that TIME is always the first element of the dimensions array, 
%   the first element of every variables.dimensions vector, 
%   and the first dimension of the variables.data matrices. 
%   This implies that single dimensional data must be stored as column vectors.
%
% The toolbox requires that each dimension has a file:
%   <toolbox>/NetCDF/template/<lower(dimension_name)>_attributes.txt
%
% Dimensions with only one value that are not used by any variables are
% collapse into global attributes.
