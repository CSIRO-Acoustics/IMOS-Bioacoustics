function [fieldTrip deployments sites dataDir] = getDeployments(auto)
%GETDEPLOYMENTS Prompts the user for a field trip ID and data directory.
% Retrieves and returns the field trip, all deployments from the DDB that
% are related to the field trip, and the selected data directory.
%
% Inputs:
%   auto        - if true, the user is not prompted to select a field
%                 trip/directory; the values in toolboxProperties are
%                 used.
%
% Outputs:
%   fieldTrip   - field trip struct - the field trip selected by the user.
%   deployments - vector of deployment structs related to the selected
%                 field trip.
%   sites       - vector of site structs related to the selected
%                 field trip.
%   dataDir     - String containing data directory path selected by user.
