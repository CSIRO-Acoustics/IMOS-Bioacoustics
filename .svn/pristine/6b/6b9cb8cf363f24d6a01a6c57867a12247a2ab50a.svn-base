 	VALIDATE   user notes
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Code is in m-files:
val2.m
val4.m
val5.m
validate.m
val_mld.m
val_util.m

Only invoke 'validate'. 

Arguments:
 - 'validate' takes up to 4 arguments - use 'help validate' for details.


Manual modifying plots:
 - since the GUI is standalone you can manipulate the plots yourself using
direct commands.

Closing submenus:
 - use the 'close' button, or things will get in a tangle.

Exiting:
 - unless you want to preserve the figures for some reason, DO accept 
the option of clearing figures when you exit (or you will end up with 
lots of figure windows when another batch are spawned with the next
use of 'validate'.).


DETAILS
~~~~~~~
Entering numbers:  there is no need to enclose numbers in square brackets.
ie  you can enter [1995 12 31]    OR    1995 12 31

Time range:
 - If you have set a time range but then want to revert to full model time
span, erase the date fields - the model dates will be written back to 
those fields. Cast data will only be actually used if within 'tdmax' days
of a model timestep (see Arguments)

Difference map: 
 - this is a map with the size and shape of markers indicating
the difference between observations and corresponding model values. It
is calculated at one depth level, which can be specified as a depth or a 
level number. When a depth or level is altered, hit Enter in that field and
the corresponding level or depth will be updated. The plot is generated
each time Enter is typed in either field.

Scatter plot: 
 -  is a plot of observed value vs corresponding model value.
A range of depth levels can be specified, in which case the colour of 
symbols indicates the depth level. Note that this range is specified in 
ascending depth value, which is descending level number. Behaviour of depth 
selection is as for "Difference map". 

Stats profile:
 - Note that the legend can be dragged to a different place on the figure.


Plot Controls:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These apply to the plot type selected at left.

Not all plots can be selected; only those I think you might need to 
play with.


Mixed Layer Depth:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MLD calculation and plotting is quite different to the treatment of
other properties, because both T and S fields are read in and interpolated
to cast positions, but the comparison data is the MLD estimates. Since
there is only 1 estimate per cast, none of the profile plots are relevant.
Also, obviously no level can be specified for the "Difference map" or 
"Scatter" figures.

The MLD plots come up automatically as soon as you have MLD calculated
for BOTH datasets. 

Algorithm details:  for now, see function mixld in val_util.m

      PROGRAMMER DOCUMENTATION
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Basically, there isn't any.

This code is maintained and has RCS backup in /home/dunn/scott/validation/.
