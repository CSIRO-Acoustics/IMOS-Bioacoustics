0, FV00, Level 0 - Raw data,                Raw data is defined as unprocessed data and data products that have not undergone quality control. The data may be in engineering physical units, time and location details can be in relative units and values can be pre-calibration measurements.
1, FV01, Level 1 - Quality Controlled Data, Quality controlled data have been through quality assurance procedures such as automated routines and sensor calibration or visual inspection and flag of obvious errors. The data are in physical units using standard SI metric units with calibration and other pre-processing routines applied, all time and location values are in absolute coordinates to comply with standards and datum. Data includes flags for each measurments to indicate the estimated quality of the measurement. Metadata exists for the data or for the higher level dataset that the data belongs to. This is the standard IMOS data level and is what should be made available to AODN and to the IMOS community.
2, FV02, Level 2 - Derived Products,        Derived products require scientific and technical interpretation. Normally these will be defined by the community that collects or utilises the data.
3, FV03, Level 3 - Interpreted Products,    These products require researcher driven analysis and interpretation, model based interpretation using other data and / or strong prior assumptions.
4, FV04, Level 4 - Knowledge Products,      These products require researcher driven scientific interpretation and multidisciplinary data integration and include model-based interpretation using other data and / or strong prior assumptions.
