function routines = listAutoQCRoutines()
%LISTAUTOQCROUTINES Returns a cell array containing the names of all 
% available automatic QC functions.
%
% Auto QC functions live in the AutomaticQC subdirectory, and are named 
% according to the format:
%
%   [routine]QC.m
%
% This function simply searches the subdirectory looking for files which
% match the above pattern, and returns the names of those files.
%
% Outputs:
%   routines - cell array of strings, each of which is the name of an
%              automatic QC function.
