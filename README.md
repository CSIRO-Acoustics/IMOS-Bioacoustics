# IMOS Bioacoustics sub-Facility
## What is Bioacoustics?
Small fish, zooplankton and squid are important components of all marine ecosystems, however quantifying their abundance, distribution and behaviour over large spatial scales is difficult using traditional net sampling methods. The IMOS Bioacoustics sub-Facility uses vessels equipped with echosounders, at single and multiple frequencies to estimate the abundance and distribution of these mid-tropic level organisms. This data is important for providing observed distribution and abundance information for ecosystem models in addition to providing a point of validation to predictions made by these models. The continued observing of Bioacoustics data from large research and fishing vessels provides this information, a powerful resource for understanding the marine ecosystem at both local and oceanic basin scales (https://imos.org.au/facilities/shipsofopportunity/bioacoustic/).
