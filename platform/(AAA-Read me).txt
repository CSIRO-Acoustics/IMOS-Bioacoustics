These text files were modified to comply with latest conventions (i.e. ICES:1.10 and IMOS: 1.4).

Please complete instrument_frequency, instrument_transducer_model, instrument_transceiver_model fields suitable for the new vessel.
Check text files of existing vessels to get an idea. 

No need to define all metadata in these text file because some fields are automatically defined, or the analyst will be asked later to complete.

Also, note that only metadata that doesn't change should be defined here - other metadata for example 'calibration_date' etc will be changing
and such metadata shouldn't be defined here.

These text files are read by the processing GUI for metadata records.
